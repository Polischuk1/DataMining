# DataMining

This project includes two folders, each containing a separate work related to data mining using different algorithms.

## Apriori Algorithm

In the first folder, you will find work related to the Apriori algorithm, a widely used data mining algorithm for association rule mining. This part of the project includes the following:

- **Prediction of 15 Most Frequently Purchased Products**: We have applied the Apriori algorithm to analyze a dataset and predict the 15 most frequently purchased products. The results can be found in the [Apriori Algorithm](Apriori%20Algorithm) folder.

- **Visualization Using Python**: We have used Python to create data visualizations, including diagrams, to represent the results of the Apriori algorithm. The code and diagrams are available in the [Apriori Algorithm](Apriori%20Algorithm) folder.

## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm

In the second folder, we explore the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, a popular algorithm for classification and regression. This part of the project focuses on:

- **Prediction of Wine Colors**: We have used the KNN algorithm to predict the color of wine based on certain features. The details of this analysis and the code can be found in the [Wine color prediction knn algorithm](Wine%20color%20prediction%20knn%20algorithm) folder.

## Usage

You can navigate to each of the subfolders for more detailed information, code, and results related to the respective algorithm. Detailed usage instructions can be found within each folder's README.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the specific folder of interest (Apriori or KNN).
